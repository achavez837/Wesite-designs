        <h2>Coffee Roasts</h2>
       
        <p>What does roast mean and why is it important? <em>“Roast levels”</em> are used to describe how long and thoroughly the coffee beans are roasted.
          The most common words to describe different levels of coffee roasting are Light, Medium, and Dark. Coffee roasting is one of the most influential factors of coffee taste.
          Roasting transforms green beans into the aromatic and flavorful coffee that wakes our senses in the morning.
          However, roasting beans at different levels achieves more than merely darkening the bean; it also changes many of the beans physical attributes as well. </p>
        <h3>Light Roast</h3>
        <p>Light Roast coffees are characterized by their light brown color, lack of oil on the beans, and light body (or viscosity).
          When roasting, beans typically pop at around 350º. This popping sound—known as the “first crack”—serves as the cue that the beans have reached a Light Roast.
          A common misconception is that Light Roasts don’t have as much caffeine as their darker, bolder counterparts. However, the truth is exactly the opposite!
          As beans roast, the caffeine slowly cooks out of the bean.
          Therefore, because lightly roasted beans cook for a shorter time and at a lower temperature, they retain more caffeine from the original green coffee bean.</p>
        <h3>Medium Roast</h3>
        <p>Medium Roast coffees are brown and have a little thicker body than a Light Roast.
          Unlike Light, Medium starts to take on a bit of the taste from the roasting process, losing some of the bright floral flavors that are typical of a Light Roast.
          Instead, they carry much more of a balanced flavor with a medium amount of caffeine. Other roasters refer to a Medium as American Roast, Breakfast Roast, or City Roast.</p>
        <h3>Dark Roast</h3>
        <p>Dark Roast coffees are dark brown, even close to a blackened color.
          The beans are characterized by drawn-out oil that glosses the surface.
          Coffee made from a Dark Roast has a robust, full body and a very bold, smoky taste.</p>

        <h2>Brewing Coffee</h2>
        <p class="centerP">All you need to make coffee is ground coffee, water, and a filter, but there is many different ways to get the perfect cup of coffee.</p>
        <div id="frenchPress">
        <img src="/Blog/images/french-press.jpg" alt="french Press" class="leftImg">
        <h3>French Press</h3>
        <p>
          We love the full-bodied coffee that comes from the French press method.
          The texture is heavier and denser than a pour over. For this reason, though French press coffee is delicious black, it thrives with milk or cream.
          French press is an immersion brew method, meaning coffee grounds are fully immersed in water and then strained using a metal filter.
          Metal filters allow oils and undissolved coffee particles to pass into the cup. For your grind size a medium grind size that’s slightly coarser than for a pour over is optimal, like very coarse black pepper.
          French Press is accessible to anyone, and works particularly well for people who love their coffee with breakfast, as the French Press doubles as a serving carafe and comes in a variety of sizes.  
        </p>
        </div>
        <img src="/Blog/images/pourOver.jpg" alt="pour over coffee pot" class="rightImg" id="pourOverImg">
        <h3>Pour Over</h3>
        <p>
          The pour over method produces coffee with a delicate and smooth texture that resides somewhere between juicy and tea-like.
          A pour over coffee’s flavor is often at its most expressive, partly due to the filtration, which adds polish and clarity to the cup, and partly due to the amount of water used in relation to the ground coffee.
          A paper filter that fits into some sort of dripper is all you need for pour over coffee.
          The paper filter results in a clarified mouthfeel as it holds back oils and undissolved coffee particles from the final cup.
          The extraction time—the span of time from the first pour to the last—should take fewer than 3 minutes to achieve the most balanced flavors.
          For your ground coffee a medium grind size about the coarseness of sea salt is optimal.
          For larger amounts you’ll want the grind size to be slightly coarser than for a single-cup dripper, otherwise, the water will overextract the coffee, resulting in bitterness.
          Pour overs are for anyone who appreciates a short but focused morning ritual and isn’t afraid to experiment.
          While drippers are considered an “entry level” manual brew tool, using one does require focus and care.
        </p>
        <h3>Coffee Bags</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re looking to make your coffee brewing experience as easy as brewing tea, you may be interested in the coffee bag method.
          This method uses coffee grounds inside of soft pouches similar to tea bags.Pour boiling water over the coffee bag and let it steep for three or four minutes. Remove the bag and enjoy!
        </p>
        <h3>Traditional Coffee Maker</h3>
        <P>
          The enduring appeal of a good coffeemaker is its convenience: decent drip coffee with the flick of a switch.
          Depends on the machine, but its anatomy is similar to a pour over dripper. A conical filter sits above a pot.
          Place a paper filter (unless the device has a built-in reusable filter), fill it with ground coffee, and press “start.”
          Like a pour over, the paper filter results in a clarified mouthfeel.
          You will want a medium grind size about the coarseness of sea salt. If making more than a couple of servings, you’ll want the grind size to be slightly coarser.
          For some, the morning is not a time of ritual. If you prize ease above all, a decent drip coffeemaker is for you.
          To optimize your coffee beans, we do recommend using a scale to weigh your fresh coffee and a decent grinder to get the right grind size. 
        </P>
        <img src="/Blog/images/siphon.jpg" alt="Siphon Coffee Maker" class="leftImg" id="siphonImg">
        <h3>Siphon Method</h3>
        <p>
          Looking like a mad scientist’s secret invention, the siphon brew method is beautiful, intricate, and theatrical, and it produces a delicate, tea-like cup of coffee.
          The technique can be quite persnickety, but it is, for our money, one of the coolest brew methods available.
          Well, how does it work? The siphon brew method uses immersion, vacuum pressure, and fire. The way the all-glass contraption works is this: water is placed into the bottom part of the siphon machine, a glass bulb.
          A flame heats the water to boiling until the water percolates upwards to the upper part of the device, called the hopper.
          Once the water reaches the right temperature, coffee grounds are added to the hot water.
          After an initial stir, remove the siphon from the heat source.
          The change of pressure and force of gravity will draw the coffee down, through the filter to the bulb.
          Grind size should be medium, like table salt. Even more important than grind size are aspects of the technique, like water temperature stability and agitation of the grounds. 
          Siphon-making is as esoteric as brew methods come, and probably best suited for the experienced enthusiast, the craft hobbyist, or for someone who enjoys showing off to her friends.
        </p>
        <img src="/Blog/images/mokaPot.jpg" alt="Moka Pot Diagram" class="rightImg" id="mokaPotImg">
        <h3>Moka Pot</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly we have the Moka Pot. The moka pot is a stovetop espresso maker with a rich history. The magic behind the Moka pot is in its 3 chambered brew process.
          Water in the bottom chamber boils, and the steam causes pressure that pushes water up through the coffee grounds into the top chamber.​
          Is the resulting shot the same as an espresso shot? No, not quite.
          If you do it right (there is a little skill involved) you’re left with a bittersweet & super-strong concoction that will get you through the day.
          One bonus to the Moka pot: you can brew multiple cups of coffee (from four to 16) at once. It’s a great way to caffeinate a crowd.
          Another bonus is its super fast. Once you’ve heated your water it should take no more than 5 minutes (a little longer if you use an induction stove).
          For that reason, it’s the go-to option for caffeine deprived people when in a morning rush.
          For your grind size you want it coarser than a fine, espresso like grind, and finer than a drip coffee grind.
          If that doesn’t help start coarse, and go finer until the texture & taste of the end result is right for you.
          Another tip is if your brew is too weak/watery, you’ve gone too course (under-extracted). Too bitter, and you’ve gone too fine (over-extracted)
          The resulting brew is not quite an espresso shot, but close to it (if you use the right grind and the right technique). Expect a sharp and strong tasting coffee.
          Now for a brief history lesson, the moka pot was invented by the Italian Alfonso Bialetti in 1933 and named after the city of Mocha, in Yemen, renowned for the quality of its coffee.
          It later migrated to Latin America and Australia with Italian immigrants in the mid-20th century.
          Moka pots, also known as grecas, are often the preferred brewing method for Dominican- and Cuban-style coffees.
          This is a perfect segway to the other beautiful coffees of the world.

        <h2>Coffee Around The World</h2>
        <p>
          Coffee looks different everywhere, but one thing that isn't different
          no matter where you go is the cultural signifacance of coffee and how
          it brings us together. Below are a few countries where coffee is ingrained not only in their culture but also their history. 
          These are just brief summaries of beautifully complex stories and if you are more intrested I implore you to learn more.
        </p>
        <img src="/Blog/images/Mexico.jpg" alt="Cafe de Olla" class="rightImg" class="roundImg" id="mexicoImg">
        <h3>Mexico</h3>
        <p>
          In Mexico, coffee is often brewed with cinnamon and sugar, called <em>café de olla</em>.
          The drink’s origin dates back to the early 1900’s during the Mexican Revolution where women made their mark on the frontlines.
          Those who participated in the war effort were called Adelitas, named after Adela Velarde Pérez, a nurse from Ciudad Juarez.
          She would become a central figure in how women were viewed during the Mexican Revolution due to her role helping injured soldiers.
          Pérez led the way for other women at war to be recognized for the contributions, one of the biggest being café de olla. 
          To keep up the stamina of these soldiers, the adelitas created a blend of spices, coffee, and sugar in giant clay pots which they would then hand out to all the soldiers for an energy boost throughout the long war.
          This blend of coffee would be called café de olla, literally meaning “coffee from a clay pot.”
          The cinnamon and sugar aren’t merely added to the coffee after brewing, but they’re incorporated right into the brewing technique.
          The result is a coffee that is sweet and spicy at the same time.
          <blockquote>
          “Without women there wouldn’t even be café de olla, These women played a huge role in those days and their influence was on the battlefield as well as in the café de olla that helped fuel soldiers. The women not only prepared the food but they also fought on the lines.”
          </blockquote>

        <h3>Columbia</h3>
        <p>
          Colombia is one of the major coffee-producing countries in the world.
          Coming in 3rd place in production (after Brazil and Vietnam), Colombia has been producing coffee since the plant was introduced to Latin America in the 1700s.
          So what do Columbians usually drink?
          Tinto Coffee or <em>"El Tinto, El Tintico"</em> is the most popular coffee-based beverage in Colombia.
          It is a black cup of coffee and depending on the region it could be between 4oz to 10oz of coffee.
          Generally, it is made using the pour over method with a cloth filter.
          Another popular version of tinto is called a Tinto Campesino, it is your basic tinto but sweetened with panela.
          In Colombian culture a tinto coffee is more than just a cup of coffee.
          It is deeply embedded in the way they socialize with family and friends.
          It is a reason to meet with a friend or a special person and have a chat with over a tinto, it is the drink that they offer you as a warmth welcome to our homes.
          Anytime there is a reason to socialize, a tinto is the glue that brings it even closer together.
          Tintos are enjoyed in Colombian homes every day at any given time. There is no defined age to when you can enjoy a tinto.
          Nor does it matter the time of day, wether it be with breakfast, after lunch or even late at night a tinto can always be enjoyed.

        <img src="/Blog/images/turkey.jpg" alt="traditional Arabic/Turkish Coffee" class="leftImg" id="turkeyImg">
        <h3>Arabic</h3>
        <p>
          In many cultures, drinking coffee is a traditional social activity, and Arabic coffee is no different.
          Arabic coffee is more than a drink in the Arab world. It is a way of life.
          Arabic coffee is ingrained within Middle Eastern and Arab culture and tradition, and is the most popular form of coffee brewed in the Middle East.
          It originated in the Middle East, beginning in Yemen and eventually travelling to Mecca (Hejaz), Egypt, the Levant, and then, in the mid-16th century, to Turkey and from there to Europe where coffee eventually became popular as well.
          Arabic coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Arab states confirmed by UNESCO.
          Arabic coffee <em>(قهوة عربية, qahwah 3arabiyya, or more often just qahwah, often pronounced ‘ahweh)</em> is the coffee drunk all over the Arab world and in other Middle Eastern countries, including Turkey, Iran and parts of North Africa.
          It’s sometimes called “Turkish Coffee” even in Arab countries, like in Egypt.
          It depends on what language you’re speaking, and who you’re saying it to.
          If you’re ordering in Arabic, you’ll just call it <em>‘ahweh</em>.
          Arabic coffee is characterized by its preparation, not the specific coffee.
          This coffee is prepared by boiling it on the stovetop in a small pot called a briki.
          You can use any type of beans, though they should be very finely ground.
          When ready, it’s transferred to an ornate coffee pot called a dallah for serving.
          Although there are many versions, Arabic coffee is typically served strong and unsweetened, flavored only by cardamom.
          Instead of having a well-defined recipe with exact measurements, this way of making coffee is passed down through Arabic families as taught by the matriarch or patriarch.
          Using a “heaping spoonful” to measure coffee and the serving cup to measure water is a common way to begin.
          Traditionally, this coffee is served unstrained, with the fine grounds settling at the bottom.

        <img src="/Blog/images/vietnam.jpg" alt="Vietnamese Coffee" class="rightImg" id="vietnamImg">
        <h3>Vietnam</h3>
        <p>
          Without a doubt, coffee culture in Vietnam is more than just an easy jolt of energy to get through a long day of work or school  – it’s a part of everyday life.
          Countless coffee shops line the urban streets of Saigon and Hanoi as well as small town roads, and no matter the time of day, they are a prime locale for socializing and relaxing.
          In fact, after pho and banh mi, Vietnamese coffee might be the most well known Vietnamese culinary export.
          Today, Vietnam accounts for 20% of the world’s total production of coffee (and 40% of the world’s Robusta beans), exporting over 1,650,000 metric tons each year.
          But it wasn't always like that.
          It wasn’t until the early 1900’s that the Robusta bean made its way to the country’s central highlands, where the region’s climate and soil provide optimal coffee-growing conditions.
          Over the coming decades, the industry would boom as plantations sprung up all over Dak Lak province and its surrounding areas.
          But what really propelled Vietnam onto the world stage of coffee were the ‘Doi Moi’ economic reforms of 1987, which greatly opened the country for trade.
          Shortly after, Vietnam would overtake Columbia to become the <Strong>world’s second largest exporter of coffee!</Strong>
          What make Robusta beans different from the more commonly used Arabica beans is that they are more bitter, less acidic, and have twice as much caffeine.
          Robusta beans produce a very dark, very strong coffee that’s beautifully balanced out by sweetened condensed milk.
          Sweetended condensed milk is used as a milk subsitute because dairy was (and arguably, still is) virtually non-existent in Southeast Asian cuisine, French nationals living in Vietnam had to import it from their mother country.
          However, the sheer volume of fresh milk and a brief shelf life make transporting large quantities of it impractical.
          Both of these aforementioned problems are remedied by removing water from cow’s milk, resulting in a thick and highly sweetened liquid which can survive long voyages and be stored for many years.
          And as luck would have it, sweetened condensed milk makes an ideal pairing with Vietnamese coffee by balancing out its intense Robusta flavours.
          We can define Vietnamese coffee as coffee made from beans grown in Vietnam served with sweetened condensed milk.
        </p>
        <img src="/Blog/images/italy.jpg" alt="cup of cappuccino" class="leftImg" id="italyImg">
        <h3>Italy</h3>
        <p>
          The Italians pretty much invented the way most of us serve and drink coffee,
          from the lingo (cappuccino, latte, macchiato) to the steam-driven espresso machine (first pioneered by Angelo Moriondo in Turin in 1884).
          Some coffee establishments even date back to the early 18th century.
          The Caffè Fiorio in Turin once slammed down cuppas for Nietzsche and the Count of Cavour.
          Cosenza’s gilded Gran Caffè Renzelli has been run by the same family since 1803!
          Most Italian coffee orders can be made by uttering a single word.
          A caffè is a strong shot of espresso (the term ‘espresso’ is rarely used in Italian coffee bar parlance).
          A macchiato is an espresso with a dash of steamed milk.
          An americano is an espresso with added hot water making for a slightly longer drink.
          But the king of all white coffees is the revered cappuccino, an espresso topped with warm frothy milk with an optional sprinkling of chocolate.
          The cappuccino is arguably the most popular type of coffee drink in Italy.
          There are a few cappuccino variations in Italy, including Cappuccino Chiaro which has more hot milk and less foam, Cappuccino Secco made with just frothed milk, and Cappuccino Scuro which has less milk and more coffee than the others.
          Depending on your preference you can increase or decrease the amounts of coffee and milk.
          However, there are no size differentials in Italy.
          The standard cappuccino comes in a 180ml porcelain cup and should be warm rather than boiling hot.
          Traditionally, cappuccini are taken in the morning since they have quite a bit of milk.

      <div id="espresso">
        <h2>Espresso</h2>
        <p>Although many people are familiar with espresso these days thanks to the Starbucksification of the world, there is often still some confusion over what it actually is largely due to “espresso roasts” available on supermarket shelves everywhere.
          First, and most importantly, espresso is not a roasting method.
          It is neither a bean nor a blend. It is a method of preparation.
          More specifically, it is a preparation method in which highly-pressurized hot water is forced over coffee grounds to produce a very concentrated coffee drink with a deep, robust flavor.
          While there is no standardized process for pulling a shot of espresso, Italian coffeemaker Illy’s definition of the authentic espresso seems as good a measure as any:
        </p>
          <blockquote>
            A jet of hot water at 88°-93°C (190°-200°F) passes under a pressure of nine or more atmospheres through a seven-gram (.25 oz) cake-like layer of ground and tamped coffee.
            Done right, the result is a concentrate of not more than 30 ml (one oz) of pure sensorial pleasure.
          </blockquote>    
        <h3>Espresso Machines</h3>
        <p>
          Nine atmospheres of pressure is the equivalent to nine times the amount of pressure normally exerted by the earth’s atmosphere.
          As you might be able to tell from the precision of Illy’s description, good espresso is good chemistry.
          It’s all about precision and consistency and finding the perfect balance between grind, temperature, and pressure.
          Espresso happens at the molecular level. This is why technology has been such an important part of the historical development of espresso and a key to the ongoing search for the perfect shot.
          Below are three of the most common espresso machines you will likely encounter.
        </p>
        <h4>Manual</h4>
        <p>
          A manual espresso machine is operated by pushing and pulling a lever.
          As you raise the lever, it draws water into the brewing chamber to saturate the coffee grounds (a step known as pre-infusion).
          Pulling the lever back down creates pressure, forcing the water through the coffee grounds and into your cup below.
          The term “pulling a shot” comes from this type of manual espresso machine.
          The exact design varies between models, but the basic idea is the same.
          With a fully manual espresso machine, you can control the pre-infusion period, the pressure and the water flow rate to customize it for each type of coffee or desired flavor profile.
          If you are an espresso aficionado, you may prefer a manual espresso machine for the amount of control it gives you.
          The trade-off is that the quality depends largely on your skill level and can be inconsistent from shot to shot.
          Many manual espresso machines don’t have temperature sensors, automated pressure or other features to ensure consistent water temperature, pressure and timing during brewing.
          Getting the right pressure and timing are in your hands, making this type of espresso machine the most difficult to use.
        </p>
        <h4>Semi-Automatic</h4>
        <p>
          In 1961, Ernesto Valente developed a design that used a motorized pump mechanism that eliminated the need for a barista to manually pump the piston to achieve the pressure needed for a shot.
          This is the design on which semi-automatic machines are still based.
          A barista uses a button or lever to start the shot pulling and decides when to stop it.
          An electrical pump automatically moves water through the brewing chamber at the right pressure, temperature and time.
          However, it’s not fully-automatic. You still have to grind the coffee, load the portafilter, tamp, and start the shot with the press of a button.
          That is really what separates semi-automatics from fully and super-automatics.
          Especially since rather than the machine, the barista decides exactly when the shot is done.
          Some semi-automatic espresso machines allow you to manually control the pre-infusion time and amount of water used, but these are usually found on commercial models in professional coffee shops.
          Residential semi-automatic espresso machines are known for producing consistent results with ease while still giving you enough control to experiment and get creative.

        <h4>Automatic</h4>
        <p>
          Automatic espresso machines give you espresso at the touch of a button, but lack some ability to customize your beverage.
          They often have built-in coffee grinders with brewing mechanisms that will automatically grind coffee, fill, and tamp the basket, then brew a predetermined amount of espresso.
          The machine uses an internal timer to cut off the shot after a certain amount of time - usually 25-30 seconds.
          These hands-off automatic espresso makers can produce highly consistent results, but leave little room for experimentation.
          If you prefer to hand craft your coffee, this type of espresso machine may not give you enough control.
          Additionally, A super-automatic or ultra-automatic espresso machine is also known as a pod espresso machine.
          This type of at-home espresso maker simply requires dropping in a capsule with pre-measured ground coffee inside, then pressing a button.
          Ultra-automatics are very convenient, but you’ll be limited to the types of coffee available in the pods that fit your model.
          There are also generally very limited options for customizing your brew to your preference.
